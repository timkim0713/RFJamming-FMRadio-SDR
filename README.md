# Project Overview
> This project aims to demonstrate our understanding of configuring SDR and system envrionment. Our project is mainly divided into 2 parts: Radio Frequency Jamming (Disrupting >WiFi/LTE Connections) and receive FM Radio signals using SDR devices.

## Project Envrioment Configuration
GNURadio 3.7.11 on Windows 10 OS and HackRF One SDR Device

## Mini RF Jammer

#### Background
>There are cases when wireless systems need to be forcefully shut down. For instance, restricting the use of wireless systems is necessary in the military due to security threats. >In order to disrupt wireless connections, Radio Frequency Jamming is used. RF Jamming is one of the simple methods that defeat wireless systems. It can forcefully disable >wireless connections of nearby devices that use radiofrequency by sending out overpowering signals to nearby, which drowns out the regular wireless frequencies and nullifies the >nearby wireless connections.

## FM Radio Receiver

#### Background
>Radio broadcasting using frequency modulation (FM) launched in the United States after Edwin Armstrong’s invention in 1933. The wide-band FM is now used all over the world, >providing accurate reproduction of the sound over broadcast radio. FM radio stations’ radio frequencies  can be intercepted in the air with SDR devices such as Hackrf One. This >way, radio stations can be accessed easily.
